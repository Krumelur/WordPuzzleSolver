# Setting up a Storage Account

In the Azure portal we need to create a storage account to persist BLOB data. 

* Create a new resource using the type "Storage Account" and wait for deployment to complete
* Open the just created resource and create a new container called "wordpuzzleuploads". Make sure to set the public access level to "Blob".
